# Blockparty



  Blockparty started out as something that would evolve over the course of three phases: Branding, Layer Comps and Design & Development.

  The first phase was coming up with an idea for a toy store logo and itâ€™s name; this logo could have been either modern or retro. Because I chose the retro route, something with an old school feel with not a lot of flashiness to it seemed like the best approach. The idea that the shops' products were collectables and could hit any and all ages was what inspired me to choose the finalized design and color palette.

  The second phase was to design the layout via layer comps in Photoshop. While touching on consistent minimalism, I wanted to be able to keep the user engaged by achieving responsive design that included a fun experience. By doing this, I had to tailor the initial layers comps logically to fit fluent user design and functionality.

  The third phase was to bring Blockparty to life. I wasn't satisfied with the way the website was originally in phase two and directed my attention toward a one page layout based on the amount of content. A list of notable specifications that were utilized in order to reach my end-goal and a summary of the overall experience can be located in the green box provided.
